## Development Fixtures

- Fixture layout lives in `test/fixtures`.
- Run `npm run fixtures:new-sandbox` to create `sandbox/vault` and `sandbox/external-root`
  from committed fixture data.
- Run `npm run fixtures:refresh-sandbox` to refresh note/external-root content while preserving
  `sandbox/vault/.obsidian`.
- Run `npm run fixtures:open-fixture` or `npm run fixtures:open-sandbox` to open either test vault
  directly in Obsidian.
- Run `npm run vault:open -- <vault-path>` to open a specific vault path.
- `scripts/dev.ts` targets `test/fixtures/sandbox/vault/.obsidian` as the default dev vault.

Environment support for additional Obsidian config folders is available in `scripts/dev.ts`:

- `OBSIDIAN_CONFIG_FOLDER` for one extra `.obsidian` path
- `OBSIDIAN_CONFIG_FOLDERS` for a comma-separated list of extra `.obsidian` paths

Example values are in `.env.example`.
